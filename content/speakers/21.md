Working in the Microservices Platform Team at Mercari, Raphael has always been fascinated by distributed systems, especially what is between them. He loves/hates to dig into network issues and understanding the interactions between all systems in an infrastructure. Recently, he has been focusing on implementing Istio in Mercari microservices architecture, while struggling most of his time with it. Any help would be really appreciated :)
