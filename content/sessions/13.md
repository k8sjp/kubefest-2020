Denso develops prototype mobility Edge/IoT platform. It fully utilize Cloud Native OSS such as Kubernetes and Envoy. To solve vehicle technical issues (e.g. No signal small capacity of computing resouces) we developed ”End to End seamless orchestrator” and ""vehicle service mesh"".
Vehicle application used to be an embedded software. By using our platform cloud native engineers can develop vehicle application on a cloud environment and deploy it on a vehicle seamlessly. No need to learn embedded skillset.
